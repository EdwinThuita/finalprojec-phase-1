# FINAL PHASE 1 PROJECT


## Description
This was final  phase 1 project where we were tasked to  build a Single Page Application (SPA). Building this application will be challenging because it will integrate everything that i have learned in phase 1. The  frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will communicate with a public API.
Every folder contains a html, css , JS and Package.json.

Project Requirements
Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. (Alternatively use an Array)

Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
